0,0.0,Ella Baila Sola,Eslabon Armado,"Compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
Bella, ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón, te cumplo todo
Me agarró, pеgadito de su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, quе al pasar fui yo
Su cuerpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta",

Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean (Uh)

Volverme una rompecorazones
Y que to's se enamoren de mí

Yo quiero vivir una vida buena
Un traguito 'e ron de almuerzo y de cena
Si me lleva el diablo, que valga la pena
Así voy a vivir y así quiero morir
Ya no tengo marido, tengo una vida buena
Tеngo un par de jevo' y una que otra jеva
Y si me quedo pobre, pobre pero buena
Yo me quiero tanto

Quiero comprar lo que quiera sin mirar la cuenta
A mí ya nadie me espera y menos me gobierna
Ciao, que ya no te quiero aquí, al la'o
Te me saliste del corazón
Al fin no eras tan bueno
Tú era' como una mala canción
Que ya ni me la recuerdo

Y bailar
Y hacer to' lo que a mí se me antoje
Volverme una rompecorazones
Y que to's se enamoren de mí

Yo que lo di todo, y cuanto me han jodido
Por eso sé que tú hoy juegas con mi mente
Por eso sé que tú no eras diferente

Tú buscando fuerzas pa' quererme, pero tan cerca de la salida

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far, it come back floating
And I watch it wash it up with the dead fish
But it ain't quite dead, it just is like this

Oh my heart, it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
Oh my heart, it's a roof in El Niño
Oh my heart, it's a roof made of straw in the jaw of El Niño

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard, it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name, I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in

Do you know the lives of brothers?
I am in the right mind
To snitch you to your mother
Do you empathise beyond the realms of yourself?
Do you try to challenge
Elements of convention
I doubt it
I doubt it
By the look of your Twitter page
You don’t think I have rights
You don’t think I should talk
You don’t believe a female
Should be pro-choice at all
You believe my friends
Of black and brown descent
Should bow and kiss the feet of holy colonialism and...
I doubt that
(we can be friends)… I doubt it

Extremist feminism I would like to provide an extensive list of writers
From Morrison to Davis

I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low

No te aferres, ya no te aferres
A un imposible, ya no te hagas
Ni me hagas mas dao
Ya noooo
Tu bien sabes que no fue mi culpa
Tu te fuiste sin decirme nada
Y apesar que llore como nunca
Ya no seguias de mi enamorada
Luego te fuiste y que regresabas
No me dijiste y si mas nada
Por que? no se
Pero fue asi
Asi fue
Te brinde la mejor de las suertes
Yo me propuse no hablarte, no verte
Y hoy que has vuelto
Ya de eso no hay nada
Ya no debo, no puedo quererte
Ya no te amo!, me he enamorado
De un ser divino, de un buen amor
Que me enseo, a olvidar
Y a perdonar
Soy honesto con ella y contigo
A ella la quiero, a ti he olvidado
Pero si tu quieres seremos amigos
Yo te ayudo a olvidar el pasado
No te aferres, ya no te aferres
A un imposible, ya no te hagas
Ni me hagas mas dao
Ya nooo!!! no no no no no",

Hate me, but they love my flow

Your back to corner with nowhere to go

If I share my yays, will you take my worst?

And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your ""eff me"" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer’s wife

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped

Gotta learn to soak it all in
'Cause time is sand that's slowly slipping
Right through my fingers
Can't shut my mouth, I'm the lead singer
Working hard on the holiday
Third winter that I've spent away
I put my my life on pause
I'll stop and hold for applause

I'm just the opener
That's all I'll ever be
I'm the opener
Full of apologies

When the credits roll
They won't include me

I don't know how to sing about sex
Those parts of my life don't intersect
I never understood
What they're all singing about
I'm staring at you from crowd
Hoping you will single me out
But that's not how it happens
Doing backflips doing backbends
Like a clown

I'm just the opener
That's all I'll ever be
I'm the opener
Getting you off for free

When you find your way home
You'll forget about me

'Cause I am full of cliches
And two note melodies
I'm a Radiohead rip off
I'd be huge in 1993
My hopes are up to nothing good
Relying on a reckless dream
I live and die for Hollywood
I sacrifice my self esteem
My hopes are doing nothing good
My hopes are doing nothing good for me
That should be me, that should be me
That should be
That should be me, that should be me
That should be

It sounds unrehearsed
Tried so hard, it hurts
Gonna get what I deserve
I'm still the opener
I'm still the opener
I'm still the opener
Someone spilled their beer on me",

Time to hang up my hat
Living life so differently
With you, it feels oh so sweet
But now I've gotta change my path

Got the heart of a fool
Tried to play it so cool
All my life I've never found
The kind of love to stick around
The kind of love that's worth waiting for

I thought I wanted to get you back
You told me this would never last
I thought I wanted to change your mind
But you were never really mine
You were never really mine, no

The wrong place, the right time
Roll with the changing tidеs
Sit around, commiserate
Times arе changing, it's too late
For anything to change my mind

I thought I wanted to get you back
You told me this would never last

And creams that keep the eczema at bay
And I felt the rhythm, and vapours and villains
And watch them as they fly away

123,,Genesis.,RAYE,"They say the twenties are the best years of your life
But I seem to be spending mine missing sunsets
'Cause I'm busy on my phone observing everyone else
How I compare and obsess
Just me, my phone, and these walls
And I've been sober for some months
But I can feel the demons waiting on my downfall
Since I'm so ugly and irrelevant
I've been losing friends as if I'm tryna get rid of them
I Googled why I'm still desperatе for validation and sedatives, huh
Callin' men who don't givе a fuck about me
Then when my mother called I pretend I'm busy
I'm tryna end up anywhere except from where I been
Curtains closed, bed bound, amphetamines
Mmm, and this devil on my shoulder, man, I'm tryna to shake him off
My ex is on my timeline, it's as if he's showing off
My self-esteem is Facetune and ring lights

Bang-bang, that's depression at the door again
You know he'll beat the door down till you let him in the room
Since you are already acquainted, you skip the foreplay
He grips you at the neck as you prepare to be screwed
You try to muster a flare, to tell somebody you're sinking
But anxiety is an index finger pressed to your lips
A whiskey bottle, it whispers, since you're already bitter
A cocktail fit for a quitter, ""Come here and give me a kiss""

I see a sad little sinner in the mirror
The devil works hard like my liver
I don't wanna be alive, but I don't wanna die
A fistful of pills and rivers in my eyes
I've got nothin' left to lose, dear God in the sky
Hear my cry, hear my cry

And make my ass look bigger so that I'm someone you aspire to

If you're thirsty like me (Like me)
Mix some pity with some self-hate
Stir it up, then add twelve ounces of rosé
That's how I make the glass half-empty and drink it down

Beneath the curse words and the insecurities
Here lies a sorry little soul
And she doesn't even know what to pray for
Still just a heart-broke bitch
But I traded the back of the nightclub, I did, for the bathroom floor
I wish I could call my ex
He would know just what to say (He don't say nothing at all now)
Brings a tear to my eye
The only thing I rely on him to do is stay declining my calls now

I see a sad little sinner in the mirror
The devil works hard, like my liver

Even though my friends, they say

What if I give myself away, to only get it given back?

So that when he sees me, I want him to

I'm simply being cautious

But he could be criminal, some sort of psychopath
Who escaped from an institution
Somewhere where they don't have girls
He could have masterminded some way to find me
He could be colorblind
How untrustworthy is that
He could be less than kind
Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh, come out of hiding
What do I do with that?
Oh, God
What if when he sees me
I like him and he knows it?
What if he opens up a door
And I can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me
My heart is set in motion
I'm not prepared for that
I'm scared of breaking open

So I came home this one day, and I am really irritated and I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy. And there's Bernie, laying on the couch drinking a beer and chewing. No, not chewing: popping! So, I said to him, I said, ""You pop that gum one more time..."" And he did. So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots... into his head

One of those Mormons, you know? So that night, when he came home from work, I fixed him his drink, as usual. You know some guys just can't hold their arsenic

One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles, back flips, flip flops, one right after the other. So this one night before the show, we're down at the hotel Cicero, the three of us boozing, having a few laughs. And we run out of ice so I went out to get some. I come back, open the door, and there's Veronica and Charlie, doing number seventeen: the spread eagle! Well, I was in such a state of shock I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing.

When you walk in the bar
And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your ""eff me"" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer’s wife

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your ""fuck me"" pumps",

Till the shining star appears

A man, he's like a briar
He covers himself with thorns
He laughs like a clown when his fortune's down
And his clothes are ragged and torn

And we'll sing hallelujah
The turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

Hanging upon the wall
He plays when somebody scrapes on the bow
Or he can't play at all

And we'll sing hallelujah
The turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

A man, he's like his father
Wishes he never was born
He longs for the time when the clock will chime
And he's dead forevermore

Lloverá y el tiempo va a pasar
Pero así pase seré tu hogar

La misma casa pero ya
Sus paredes hay que pintar
El mismo amor, mismo lugar
Los recuerdos nunca se irán
Misma guitarra pero ya
Las cuerdas tienes que cambiar
Tu vuеla y no mires atrás
Tu solo vuela

Things are ever changin'
Five-star dreamin', then we would be livin’
Like we should be
I am not a pilot
Look at how we're flying 'round the things that we decided
Like my peace and quiet, but the kids do not agree
And you'd swear by your degree
That you'd be smarter than me

Still got held back
I grew my hair back
No hangtime, no hairline
No more swimmin' by myself

Rather feel ashamed than be unhappy
When it’s all said and done, I want you in the moonlight (Ooh-ooh)

Mitchell put books are old, but now you hold my hand
It takes some time to get there
Hope you understand that it won’t be long (Long, long, long)

I was stoppin' shoppin'
Had to get a run in
Rode my bike instead of drivin'
Easy to forgive me when there’s milk and pastries
Even when we argue, I'm in love with you
Even when you saucy at the barbecue
Better than better now
How 'bout another round?
Only another mile
85 but it feel like 200

We go home and we don't do nun' (Oh)

They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change.

You see it on the street again
Lighting up the strangest faces

I could break a glass just to watch it shatter
I'd do anything just to feel with you

Alright

I see it in your teeth again
There's a tightness when you're smiling
It creeps in through the backdoor when
You play pretend and break down crying

And it feels likе that
'Cause you're wishing you had something you nеver had
But now we're going back
To being sixteen, flying like you’ll never collapse

I'd give you the world if you asked me to

Quick, give me a glass, I'ma watch it shatter

I know there's people everywhere with injustice on their lips
And there's this open wound bleeding between my hips
And I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't scared
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared
I'm scared and I've got all this anger trapped so deep inside
That started burning the summer my heroes died
And I just wish that I could hear a new Bowie again
Again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, oh, yeah

I'd give you the world if you asked me to
I could break a glass just to watch it shatter

Right before Mr. Ammond's class (I like that)

Thrift store, thrift clothes, that was all I knew
Do you remember? (I like that)
Uh, I remember when you laughed when I cut my perm off
And you rated me a six
I was like, ""Damn"" (I like that, I like that)
But even back then with the tears in my eyes
I always knew I was the shit

I like that
I don't really give a fuck if I was just the only one

Tenía dolores viejos que atender de aquel pasado
Entonces regresé a ese silencio necesario
Para escuchar el corazón hablar de la verdad
De la vеrdad que son esos atardecеres
De la verdad que brilla en el tiempo presente
De la verdad que hay en aquellas simples cosas, como respirar

Perdona, que me tuve que ausentar por un momento
Había una flor secándose dentro de casa
Tenía olvidado cómo hacerle compañía a la soledad de mi viejo jardín de Veracruz

Perdona si lloré, lloré, lloré mientras bailaba
Tenía dolores viejos que atender de aquel pasado
Entonces regresé a ese silencio necesario
Para escuchar el corazón hablar de la verdad

Luego gota de sudor, que se hizo vapor, luego viento
Que en un rincón de La Rioja, movió el aspa de un molino
Mientras se pisaba el vino que bebió tu boca roja
Tu boca roja en la mía, la copa que gira en mi mano
Y mientras el vino caía, supe que de algún lejano rincón
De otra galaxia, el amor que me darías
Transformado, volvería un día a darte las gracias

Cada uno da lo que recibe
Y luego recibe lo que da
Nada es más simple, no hay otra norma
Nada se pierde, todo se transforma

El vino que pagué yo con aquel euro italiano
Que había estado en un vagón, antes de estar en mi mano
Y antes de eso en Torino, y antes de Torino, en Prato
Donde hicieron mi zapato sobre el que caería el vino
Zapato que en unas horas buscaré bajo tu cama
Con las luces de la aurora junto a tus sandalias planas
Que compraste aquella vez, en Salvador de Bahía
Donde a otro diste el amor que hoy yo te devolvería

Cada uno da lo que recibe
Y luego recibe lo que da
Nada es más simple, no hay otra norma
Nada se pierde, todo se transforma

Desde el día en que te vi sin dudarlo supe que eras para mí
Lo que no sabías es que yo era para ti
Y ahora estamos aquí
Dame un beso please, baby
Y a mí me gusta cuando tarde me llama
Sabes que mi cuerpo al tuyo reclama
No sé lo que pasó pero me enamoro
Ahora 24/7 conmigo te quiero yo

Me encanta cuando inventa y se mueve en cámara lenta
Me gusta como eso se ve
Tu boca me tienta
Ya perdí la cuenta de cuanto te quiero, bebé

Baby dame un beso
Que me enamore en el proceso
Un beso que me deje preso
En la cárcel de tu cuerpo, mujer
Baby dame un beso
Que me enamore en el proceso
Un beso que me deje preso
En la cárcel de tu cuerpo, mujer

Tú estás de capo, artista, funcionario y pelotero
Un hombre que te represente con mucho dinero
Que cuando tú diga “es un helicóptero que quiero”
“¿En efectivo, señor?” Si, que coja quince pasajeros
Un caballero, a los hombre de este tiempo que le pasa
Invierten en mujeres de la calle y no en la de su casa
Por eso te vo’a mandar a hacer un castillo con diez terrazas
Con seguridad con arma larga y diez perros de raza
Pa’ que si se asoma el tipo ese que te maltrato
O la tipa que necesitaste y nunca te ayudo
Tú le diga desde el intercom “Se pueden ir los dos”
Y si no se van “Terri y Bobby comancelo a to’”

Me encanta cuando inventa y se mueve en cámara lenta
Me gusta como eso se ve
Tu boca me tienta
Ya perdí la cuenta de cuanto te quiero, bebé

Why didn't you call me?
Why didn't you kiss me
My lips have been doing without
Why didn't you kiss me
That's part of what lovin's about
Never had enough
Squeezing and holding
But you're like a drug and baby I'm jonesin' your lovin'
Why didn't you call me?

Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling, can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied

304,,Telling Stories,Tracy Chapman,"There is fiction in the space between
The lines on your page of memories
Write it down but it doesn't mean
You're not just telling stories
There is fiction in the space between
You and reality
You will do and say anything
To make your everyday life seem less mundane
There is fiction in the space between
You and me
There's a science fiction in the space between
You and me
A fabrication of a grand scheme
Where I am the scary monster
I eat the city and as I leave the scene
In my spaceship I am laughing
In your remembrance of your bad dream
There's no one but you standing
Leave the pity and the blame
For the ones who do not speak
You write the words to get respect and compassion
And for posterity
You write the words and make believe
There is truth in the space between
There is fiction in the space between
You and everybody
Give us all what we need
Give us one more sad sordid story
But in the fiction of the space between
Sometimes a lie is the best thing
Sometimes a lie is the best thing
Ohh the best thing
Is the best thing
Ohh the best thing

Say you'll talk about the horrors you've seen
And the torment you know
And tell it like it is

Say it, say it, say it
So no one can forget
Say it, say it, say it
Tell it like it is

What keeps you awake at night
What makes you want to break the ties that silence and bind
And tell it like it is

Say you'll never cover your ears and close your mouth
And live in a silent world
Say you'll only run as far or as fast as you need to be secure
Say that then you'll tell the truth
When a lie could cross your lips
And tell it like it is

Say it, say it, say it. Say it, say it, say it

Όταν θα τ' απαντήσεις, τότε ξέρεις τι γυρεύεις
Ταξιδιώτες για να βρούμε τη βαλίτσα
Σε ένα καινούργιο κόσμο που 'χει την παλιά του δίψα
Γεννά πηγές να ξεδιψάμε οι διψασμένοι
Μα πέφτει σταγόνα η τοξικότητά μας και όλα τα μαραίνει
Δεν πρέπει τα βαριά τα λόγια μέσα μας να καθήσουνε
Όσο τα κουβαλάμε, το ταξίδι μας θα τ' αργήσουμε
Αυτός ο λογισμός κι αυτή η μεγάλη οδύνη
Να περπατάς στο χώμα δε σ' αφήνει
Και θα σε τυραννά χειμώνα-καλοκαίρι
Αν φύγεις μακριά σε άλλα μέρη
Να δεις για τόπους όμορφους που δεν κατέχεις
Γιατί άλλο λογισμό και έγνοια δεν έχεις
Να δεις τι κάνουνε στα ξένα πώς περνούνε
Και πώς πορεύονται και πώς μιλούνε
Να δεις τα χέρια των ανθρώπων πώς αλλάζουν
Στα νιάτα πώς υπάρχουν πριν γεράσουν
Βρύσες να δεις και ποταμούς, χωριά και δάση
Να σου φανεί παράξενο ο κόσμος πώς αλλάζει
Έχω εγκλωβιστεί στα θέλω μου, σ' αυτά που μου φορτώσαν
Μα ελεύθερο μ' αφήσαν στο κλουβί που με κλειδώσαν
Να κελαηδώ σα βάρδος για του Βασιλιά τη δόξα
Να εξυμνώ κατακτητές χωρίς ιερά και όσια
Ήθελα να δω τον κόσμο να πειστώ, να μη πιστέψω
Το τέρας που όλοι μέσα μας κρατάμε να το δέσω
Στο δέντρο της ζωής που κάπου λένε υπάρχει εκεί έξω
Να μη σκοτώνει για την εξουσία και να τ' αφέσω
Το απέραντο που δούμε να ξυπνά
Απ' το βαθύ λήθαργο της χειμερίας μας τη δημιουργία
Ο σεβασμός στη φύση επιστρέφει αθανασία
Τα μάτια μας να φέρουνε βροχές για ξηρασία
Να τραβήξω τις γραμμές που αφήνει πίσω το καράβι
Να κουνήσεις το μαντήλι σου λευκό μες στο σκοτάδι
Κι όταν γυρίσω πίσω με πνευματικό χρυσάφι
Να μοιραστεί στον κόσμο μην πονά τη Γη να σκάβει
Λάθη να μετανιώσω σιωπηλά να ακούω τον ήχο από το τζάκι
Μέσα του που σιγοκαίγονται τα λόγια που ανταλλάξαμε στη μάχη
Κάθε νίκη επιφέρει ευθύνη
Μη πιαστείς απροετοίμαστος για ότι καλό σου γίνει
Όσο κι αν ταξιδέψεις και να κατακτήσεις τόπους
Καμιά χαρά κατάκτησης δεν θα 'χεις αν δεν έχεις
Στο λιμάνι της επιστροφής σου ανθρώπους
Μέτρα τα βέλη στη φαρέτρα σου για πόσους φτάνουν στόχους",

321,,get him back!,Olivia Rodrigo,"One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting ""send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; Woo)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back; Yeah, you got it)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas, pullin' up Volkswagen jettas
Causin' storms in sunny weather, in sunny whether, in sunny weather

A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay",

Dejarlo todo sin decir nada
Y abrirle paso al instinto

Parece ser suficiente
Para quedarme y dejar que duerma
Ese antiguo sueño en mi mente
Llevaba conmigo a todas partes
Un cuadernito de flores
Donde escribía todos mis planes
Mis sueños y mis temores
Hasta que un día, como si nada
Me encontré con tu sonrisa
Y mi cuaderno quedó olvidado
Hasta convertirse en ceniza
Y aunque muy de vez en cuando
Se asoman por la ventana
Esas viejas ilusiones
Que me despiertan las ganas
La vida me está enseñando
Que no hay por qué tener prisa
Si me toca morir joven
Pues que me mate tu risa

What robber?
What thief?

The method and moment in time?

Was it a trickster
Using mirrors and sleight of hand?
A strong elixir
Or a potion that you drank?

Who hurt your heart?
Bruised it in a place
That no one and nothing can heal

You've gone to wizards
Princes and magic men
You've gone to witches
The good, the bad, the indifferent
But still all sentiment is gone
But still you have no trust in no one

If you can tear down the walls
Throw your armor away
Remove all roadblocks barricades
If you can forget there are bandits
And dragons to slay
And don't forget that you defend an empty space

And remember the Tin Man
Found he had what he thought he lacked
Remember the Tin Man

Who stole your heart
Maybe no one can say

They made you a crown out of peonies

And Daddy told you to stay indoors

Too old to play and too young to mess around

I'd find some other way to cause you pain
I won't bother telling you I'm sorry
For something that I'm gonna do again

Do I get callous or do I stay tender?
Which of these is worse and which is better?
Dying to myself virtually, a massacre
A character of somebody's invention
A martyr in another passion play
I guess I don't mind losing my conviction
If it's all relative fiction anyway

But we’ve come to increase time in between ticks
And there is romance in the slow dances
‘Cause they’re fertile in hush, futile in haste
These are your nerves, this is how they taste

Well, I can’t count how many times I’ve been outdone by nihilism
Joined the march that splits an open heart into a schism
I cower at the thought of other people’s expectations
And yet, still hand over mine to them

Travel where you are, tourism is sin
These are the ruins we left behind, you can’t take pictures of them
If what they say is true, then you become what you chew
If it decays spit it out, affectation is a drought

That you wait through when you hate everything that you do
You wanna live outside the groove, then fine
But it’s there like a flower blooming in your ears
Open up your mouth, pollinate your peers

With your wrinkled hands and your silver hair
Leaving here soon and you know where
To where the cattail sways with the lonesome loon
You’ll be riding that train in late June

414,,Neighborhood #3 (Power Out),Arcade Fire,"I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents' hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swinging from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds

I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shouting that they found the light
(We found the light!)
Shadows jumping all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small
I went out into the night
I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ, don't keep it hid!

Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo

Ice has covered up my parents' hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
Growing up in some strange storm
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm
I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are dying out in the snow
Look at them go, look at them go!

Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Oo-oo

And the power's out in the heart of man
Take it from your heart, put it in your hand, hand
What's the plan?
What's the plan?

Is it a dream? Is it a lie?
I think I'll let you decide
Just light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ, don't keep it hid!
Because nothing's hid
From us kids!
You ain't fooling nobody
With the lights out!

And the power's out in the heart of man
Take it from your heart, put it in your hand
And there's something wrong in the heart of man
You take it from your heart and put it in your hand!

430,,Tu Falta De Querer,Mon Laferte,"Hoy volví
A dormir en nuestra cama y todo sigue igual
El aire y nuestros gatos, nada cambiará
Difícil olvidarte estando aquí
Te quiero ver
Aún te amo y creo que hasta más que ayer
La hiedra venenosa no te deja ver
Me siento mutilada y tan pequeña

Ven y cuéntame la verdad
Ten piedad
Y dime por qué
No, no, no
¿Cómo fue que me dejaste de amar?
Yo aún podía soportar
Tu tanta falta de querer

Hace un mes
Solía escucharte y ser tu cómplice
Pensé que ya no había nadie más que tú
Yo fui tu amiga y fui tu compañera
Ahora dormiré
Muy profundamente para olvidar
Quisiera hasta la muerte para no pensar
Me borro pa' quitarme esta amargura

Ven y cuéntame la verdad
Ten piedad
Y dime por qué
No, no, no
¿Cómo fue que me dejaste de amar?
Yo aún podía soportar
Tu tanta falta de querer

Ven y cuéntame la verdad
Ten piedad
Y dime por qué
No, no, no
¿Cómo fue que me dejaste de amar?

431,,Canción de Amor,Viniloversus,"Hoy me provocó cantarte
Recordarte, viejo amor
Tú eras Venus, yo era Marte
Ambos viendo un mismo sol

Sin nada que decir ni hacer
Tan solo contemplarnos

Canción de amor
No me sirves
Tu amor
Es tan predecible
Tu Sol (tu Sol), tu Si (tu Si)
Tu La, tu Re
No pidas que cante que no me la sé

Siempre era tarde para el desayuno
Tan solo comer y volverse a acostar
Contigo hacer nada es mejor pasatiempo
(Contigo hacer nada es mejor pasatiempo)
Que no hacer nada y ver tiempo pasar
(Que no hacer nada-da-da-da-da-da)
Hoy las nubes, son rosadas
Recuerdo que así te gustaba
Nos quedabamos encerrados
Responsabilidades a un lado
Alquilábamos mil películas
Inventabas excusas ridículas
Y decías que dormías
En casa de Ana María

Sin nada que decir ni hacer
Tan solo contemplarnos

Canción de amor
No me sirves

Do I even know what your face looks like
Or just the cloud of smoke in its place?
I'm trying to tell you something you might've heard before

You got a dollar in your pocket
You got a pebble in your sock and
You've got a mind of gold you keep secret
I gotta hope that one day you'll use it
I get tongue-tied every time I try
To tell you what I think is right
'Cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
Looking like a toy in the lost and found
I am telling you something you might've heard before

Strange torpedo on the loose

Your words are slurred and your cheeks are red
You'd do anything to stop pretending
Can't have regrets if you can't remember them
You are one of a kind, I cannot lie
You're wild when your body's in overdrive
And I'm more surprised every time you're alive
When I check for your breath in the morning

I feel short in the exchange
I show you mine, you walk away
I'm wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see
But I'll remember your face for years to come
And wonder what you thought about when you got home
Honesty is like a kiss on the lips
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is
Now I'm barely breathing, I'm moving ahead
But if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead
I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
From whatever drug you used to put me under
I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
It's hard enough for me to not fall in love with every person I see
I let my mind get turned inside out
Just to see what the kids were laughing about
It wasn't worth understanding something
I could've gone my whole life not knowing
You know what they say about curiosity
That murderer had his chokehold on me
I ran away without turning back
But every now and then, I want what I can't have
I'm still thinking of a man from years ago
Eyes open wide in the front row
Dark features, leaning on the doorframe
I would've sold my soul to know his first name

Asked me all the questions that your parents wouldn't answer
How could I deny a diamond in the rough?
You let me in your world until you had enough
You knew that I wanted you to bend the rules
How did I believe I had a hold on you?
You were always stronger than people suspected
Underestimated and overprotected
When I went away, it was the only option
Couldn't trust myself to proceed with caution
The most that I could give to you was nothing at all
The best that I could offer was to miss your calls

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

And it happens over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
I wish I was over it, over it, over it, over it

A hidden gem, my own goldmine
You had the wide and wild eyes
You were a secret to yourself
You couldn't keep from anyone else
Now you're the biggest, brightest flame
You are a fire that can't be tamed
You're better than ever, but I knew you when
It's bittersweet to see you again",

It would only take the energy to fix it

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I tried, I can't
Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out

Drag racing through the canyon
Singing ""Boys Don't Cry""
Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement?
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I lied, I am
Just lowering your expectations
Half a mind that keeps the other second-guessing

And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos
Ask you easy questions about work and school

I'm trying to be cool about it
Feelin' like an absolute fool about it
Wishin' you were kind enough to be cruel about it
Tellin' myself I can always do without it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

I came prepared for absolution, if you'd only ask
So I take some offense when you say, ""No regrets""
I remember it's impossible to pass your test

But I'm trying to forget about it
Feelin' like I'm breaking a sweat about it
Wishin' you would kindly get out of my head about it
Tеllin' myself, one day, I'll forget about it
Knowing that it probably isn't truе

Once, I took your medication to know what it's like
And now I have to act like I can't read your mind
I ask you how you're doing and I let you lie

But we don't have to talk about it
I can walk you home and practice method acting

To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire

I could go and buy a motorcycle
With a sissy bar to sit you on the back
But every mile feels like survival
When you're always so afraid you're gonna crash
I'm sure that after just a little while
We both decide that we should take it back
Pulling on the throttle with white knuckles
Oh honey, we're just not cut out for that
Maybe letting go isn't so bad

I could touch you again

God damn, I’m lucky
So I’m gonna keep putting my pen to the pad
And not worry about the money

And sometimes it gets scary

But at least they’re blackbеrries

Even a 'sorry but not today'
A sign of life would bring relief
Even a 'thank you, but no thank you'
'Good bye'
'Take care'
'I already got one'
I thought I heard you laugh once, no?
I guess it must have been a ghost
I don't see no one
Every time I get close
Can't keep you around
Thought I knew you
But it must have been a ghost
'Cause I don't see no one

Run a bit faster
So I know if you wanted
You could give me an answer

When all that matters is that I know

Twiddling his thumbs for two weeks
No Letter has he received
Are you one of those people
That would rather disappear
Than show up and disagree?
Give us a 'thank you, but no thank you'

'Take care'
'I already got one'
We cried together once, no?
I guess it must have been a ghost
I don't see no one

Of your laughter haunting me
Is it your voice in my memory
Or the wind being cruel and taunting me

Faithful and constant to the end
When I look back at happiness
I will remember you
We were almost a love song, hey
I wish that I could bring you back to me
You're my missing melody
I wish my words could move your heart
To see that you belong here next to me
As the wind keeps gently sighing
With every breath your name I'm crying
In my empty life there's no music
And the silence won't let me go
Only the wind to remind me
That I need you more than I'd ever know
It looks like a ghost town in my mind
Where we are dancing out of time
I feel like a poet out of rhymes
Looking for one last word
We were almost a love song, hey
I wish that I could bring you back to me
You're my missing melody
I wish my words could move your heart

The day I finally met you like I knew I would
You raised me from the wreck of my doubt
You were smiling to yourself as if we both understood
The silent language of the anguish of a heart that sings but doesn't make a sound

What did I do to deserve you?
How did you find me? I was already halfway gone
You were a bright light
You were a fistfight, oh

Nobody told me all the patience it takes
For the sky to open up around me
They said love is grabbing blindly at a pit full of snakes
And wait to feel the only heel among the rows of all the venomous teeth

What did I do to deserve you?
How did you find me? I was already halfway gone
You were a bright light
You were a fistfight, oh

Our love is older than the Great Wall
Our love spins a gun around its finger
Our love has found its way into our mouths before
Cut our teeth until we swallow it whole
Our love hums low beneath the floorboards
Our love grows flowers in the winter
Our love has found its way onto our tongues before
There is more, so take a bite and let it linger

Wore my language like an amaranth and brand on my tongue (Ah)

I put my hands in the fire, watched my welcome wear thin
Salt in my wounds and spit in my eye

You're a dark toothed liar, and you're caught up in smoke
Pour acid in your glass, and I watch you choke
I rue the day I met you, and I curse the words you spoke

I ain't your savior, I ain't your saint
I cut the rope you keep me on, and I dug up your grave
You're envious of ghosts and where their hands have been
You got no marrow in them bones, just trouble and sin

I've eaten all the seeds you yearn to give
When I was born, she made a garland of the broken weeds
I've always worn it and forever she has lived

How did you know? When I would go
When I swim back to you
I can only tread water while you tend to my other
She is only lonely for you

Back when all her quiet words were thunder
And her answers were all crooked little truths
I was heavy as a hazard in an unmade bed
Spinning lies with empires for my youth

How did you know? When I would go
When I swim back to you
I can only tread water while you tend to my other

I can build a nest in any scaffold
Dwelling in the revelry I keep
I'm traveling in a nightmare on a map back to the greenhouse
Take me to the garden where my daydreams sleep

Two shots in my head
I'm falling, my legs kick in my bed
I remembered what my mama had said
""Now child""
You never could, baby

I just know my heart's not there yet
Or maybe I'm just waiting on someone to wake me

I don't really know where my head's at
I just know my heart's not there yet
Or maybe I'm just crazy
About the thought of thinking I adore you",

She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

That you're going to have to change or you're going to have to go with girls

Remember she wants to be by your side
Be by your side

If only it would land on something soon

Woke up to hear her say that she couldn't stand it
That she couldn't stay
Out here on the road, it didn't feel right
Shе listed the things about me shе didn't like
I sat there in silence, accepted our fate
We always found it hard to relate
To what we both want, and what we both need
And who we both want to be

Go, use your head, buy another loaf of bread

You grew smaller to me that Saturday when
You came crashing, crawling down through the back brush
Eyes were bloodshot and your leaden voice thin
You said, ""I won't blame you now""
But I caught your cold somehow
Then you jumped right in

Oh, I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So, for me, why won't you try?

Said you're sorry you were drinking through the day, then
Only stopped to let your lungs take the hit
You said, ""I won't blame you now
But you lost my love somehow""

No wedding Saturday within the month of June

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring

To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

As you bit into your strawberry lace

And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

Walk down the aisle
Without pulling her close, saying, ""I love you""

And asking what life was like for her
Before you came to be around

Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim

I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest;
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest

I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and play like a stone
Could be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home

My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift!
And you tell me with your tongue
And your breath goes in my lungs
And we float over the rift

I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and play like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home


Well this will be your simple song
To say what you've done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
Your shore must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun

Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the axe struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew",

Soy capitán, soy capitán, soy capitán
Ya no llores llorona, ya no llores llorona
Mi gente lucha contra leyes racistas
Contra leyes racistas en Arizona
Ay, arriba y arriba ay arriba y arriba y arriba iré
Yo no soy de la migra
Yo no soy de la migra
Ni lo seré, ni lo seré, ni lo seré
Yo sí vengo del valle
Yo sí vengo del valle de San Gabriel
Porque allí nos creamos
Porque allí nos creamos, nuestra familia

Soy chicano, soy chicano, soy chicano
Que vivan las mujeres (que vivan)
Que vivan, que vivan las mujeres de East L.A
Porque bailan La Bamba

Pero arriba y arriba
Ay, arriba y arriba y arriba iré
Como las Zapatistas

Yo lucharé, yo lucharé, yo venceré

Mi chicana preciosa es mi adoración
La que tiene cautivo

Ay, arriba y arriba ay arriba y arriba y arriba iré
Yo no soy por la guerra

Ni apoyaré, ni apoyaré, ni apoyaré

Y me toca La Bamba y me toca la bamba con el requinto
Ay, arriba y arriba ay arriba y arriba y arriba arriba iré

Hey!

Que humadera que nos viene ahogando
La gente se pregunta nadie sabe qué es
Un carro viejo que viene pitando
Con llantas de triciclo y el motor al revés
En la esquina yo esperando
Como siempre su novia fiel
Mis amigas se estan burlando
Murmuran cosas de él

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Miren muchachas que no me arrepiento
Y tampoco me avergüenzo yo de mi galán
Aunque sea pobre y tenga un carro viejo
Me trata como reina
Un hombre de verdad
Y aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero si es mi novio fiel

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear

No nos vayas a dejar

Y diciendo

Johnny 'El Men' casi dormía

""No hay cama pa' tanta gente""

Vi al Gran Combo que llegaba
Y Ramito el de 'La Altura'
Más atrás Johnny Ventura
Con Yayo 'El Indio' charlaba
Roberto Torres estaba
Con Javier Vásquez y su gente

La salsa quería empezar y Héctor Lavoe
Al llegar, tarde, encontró que La Selecta
Ya se encontraba dispuesta
Para alegrar el ambiente
Y en una esquina Tito Puente
Empezaba a pestañear y volvió Celia a gritar:
""¡Azúcar!, no hay cama pa' tanta gente""

A Odilio junto al Gallito
Lo vi en la mesa senta'o
Y Daniel Santos gilla'o de ron, se daba un traguito
Tavín 'taba jalaito

De café negro una taza y todo el mundo pa' su casa

871,,Perfectly Out Of Place,Dreams We've Had,"Take me back where I was your only friend
When I was patiently waiting on your response
You're perfectly out of place

You say if I can't love myself
Then how the hell can I try to love you?
Did you forget how it first felt
Or did you feel nothing when I held on to you?

You're perfectly out of place
You're perfectly out of place

It made me wanna hurt myself
But I would never do that to you
But I still thought it through
Sleep tonight and think this through
You are the only one that I care about

You're perfectly out of place
And you're so beautiful
I wish I could reach out and touch you
Soft skin, your lips
I could die, I could die and never cry again
Soft skin, your lips
I could die, I could die and never cry again

And I'll just say it outright
I won't try to be poetic or silly
I cut myself on the bathroom floor with scissors and I bled
I couldn't reconcile the pain I had so I made myself breathe a new way
And I tried to hide my scars
But when you saw the bloodstains on my bedsheets
You said “What's wrong?” and held me
And I felt loved
And I felt loved for the first time in what seems like forever
And as you grasped me tight I felt like I was in the arms of God
And there I wailed
And there I wailed
You're perfectly out of place",

Regardless of all the hateful things he spoke
9/11 was in the name of God, killing people in the name of God

Now at twenty-nine, the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at thirty, I'll see a way to change

To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need

So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me, but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry, it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day, until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh, I know

So I give it up to you, I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do, not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender

Heat lightning, watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky flutters in a dream
Well, I've held on, but feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

But just because she has seventeen cats doesn't make her a witch...

Hilda agreed to come over for the barbecue we have every Saturday afternoon
And she and I were having a drink

And Donald was making hot dogs and hamburgers
When all of the sudden I looked over at him and he started barking
And he started twitching
And he started swearing uncontrollably

No one can help us but the witch next door
The devil lives in my husband's body

Hilda said that he was possessed by the devil and needed an exorcism right away
I sent him to the hospital instead
And two weeks later the doctor called me back and said Donald had some...

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno

Hey!
Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand (Ch, ch, ch)
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
When he calls your name, it all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams

Hey

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (No, no)
We don't talk about Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno)

He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead (No, no)

He told me I'd grow a gut, and just like he said (No, no)

He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (No, no)

Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine

Óye, Mariano's on his way

He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach, betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now (Hey, sis)
(I want not a sound out of you) It's like I can hear him now
I can hear him now

Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno

Isabela, your boyfriend's here

Time for dinner

It was my wedding day, we were getting ready; it was our wedding day; grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling, I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling; a seven-foot frame, rats along his back; (He told me that the life of my dreams)
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky; no clouds allowed in the sky; I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch, ch, ch; when he calls your name, it all fades to black; (Would be promised and someday be mine)
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin; thunder; it's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling, always left Abuela and the family fumbling; yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams; (He told me that my power would grow)
You telling this story or am I?; I'm sorry, mi vida, go on; grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand, do you understand?; (Like the grapes that thrive on the vine, I'm fine)

Óye, Mariano's on his way

Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""; why did he tell us?; he told me that the man of my dreams; a seven-foot frame, rats along his back; (He told me that the life of my dreams)
In doing so, he floods my brain; Abuela, get the umbrellas; would be just out of reach, betrothed to another, another; when he calls your name, it all fades to black; (Would be promised and someday be mine)
Married in a hurricane; what a joyous day, but anyway; And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'll be fine; yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams; (And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)

He's here
Don't talk about Bruno

Why did I talk about Bruno?

Not a word about Bruno

I never shoulda brought up Bruno",
897,,Flesh & Bone,Sammy Rae & The Friends,"Today would have been the perfect day to go to the beach
I'm on the sofa trying to get over a hate speech
We do not love ourselves the way the prophets teach
Even Jesus kept his feelings like a lamp in the dark
Until he flipped the tables over up in the market
Oh Mother, there are lamps but there are sparks

But I need to know
I don’t need to be shown
I've gotta see it for myself
I've gotta learn it on my own
I need to know if I am flesh & bone
And am I still growing or full grown?
Am I still growing, or full grown?

She has come to a place and she feels like her love’s gone
She has come of an age and a line should be drawn

Its real tough when your daddy don’t call you enough, oh

I need to know if I am flesh & bone
And am I still growing or full grown?
Am I still growing, or full grown?
Oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, ooh

Striking matches to watch ‘em burn in my childhood bedrooms
Little time, little water and light, little seed, every bud blooms
And I've been striking matches to watch ‘em burn in my childhood bedrooms, ooh
Little time, little water and light, little seed, every bud blooms, oh
There are days I need to tell myself I’m doing alright
My inner child and my ego get caught up in a knife fight
I get nervous, and then I will get out of sight
'Cause everybody I came up with says that I’m going too slow, woah
But it’s cool though, 'cause I can hear my people when I check out the show
I feel real low

'Cause I need to know
I don’t need to be shown
I've gotta see it for myself
I've gotta learn it on my own
I need to know if I am flesh & bone
Am I still growing? I am a full grown

And am I still growing or full grown, honey?

Tell me, baby, a-do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it wouldn't surprise me

""Merry Christmas"", I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I loved you, I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if ya kiss me now, I bet you'd fool me again
And I said

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
And then the very next day, you gave it away
Oh, this year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to somebody special


A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I keep on hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone I could rely on
Me? I guess I was just a shoulder you could cry on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
Got a man under cover but you tore me apart
No, no-oh-oh-oh-oh
But now I've found a love, you'll never fool me again
I said

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
And then the very next day, you gave it away
Woah oh oh, this year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to somebody special, ah

I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There’s something in this sound that takes me far
It’s like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar

She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I’ll go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful

You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun when winter starts

She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the beat is mine
It will rock us through the night
And where I’ll go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful

Blues like doos, warm from the rhythm, soul that glues
That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
The hop is my home, rap is my grind
I'm grindin' on the backside of life, we dance
She threw me a chance, her hands in my pants
Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight
Whispering a dream I could hold in the night
Blood tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
Wake up and write it on a pad, the pains
Like church, the organ will invite the tears
Like birth, I'm cryin', let you know I'm here
Held by the song that gave me a name
Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
(There’s just a bass in the line) safe to inhale
And if you live well
Belonger years in this state, you will be
A timeless octave to play for the tree
That’s rooted in every single nerve in me
The nerve of he who ignores the key
And use it to open the minds that be free
Whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free
Beneath the clouds, you allowed to see, in clarity
Through harmony, someone harmin’ me?
That won't be done
I stand protected by the laws of fun
I am perfected through the rhymes of Run
Walkin' this way and leave the party stunned
This music, it launched me
With no aim, I've landed with some plane
Where I am I can't explain or never know
But it's beautiful so...

You can’t take this away from me

The waves bring clarity
Running through me (C'mon y'all)

Gave up the love of my life to be alone with myself

Hoping for the sunset

I'm the only one that's gonna take my call
At the end of the day, what's it all for?

In denser places like thighs or nails or secret stomach aches
Blood is humming us
A constant tone accompanying the incessant muscling
Pumping us in out, in out, in out, in out, in out, in out
The vowel of self
Blood is steadying
Lunged pendulums in threads of muted currents
Ferrying air around and round its labyrinthian orbit
Through the fleshy underside of this
Our atmospheric sea
Blood is ignited engine here at the core of all creation
With your key to our mystery's spark
Bursting just beneath the surface
Pushing time lapse blooms of newly aired blood outward
While inward bound
To central brain and each extremity
As different as they are all alike
One fauna all inhaling
All flora's breath
Lest we forget
Look, this leaf
Veins patterned by fractal giving
Oxygen you carry now within
A cell of blood threaded in
All parts of this body we too will grow to give and be
Blood is
Pulsing vast beyond our vein tips...",

And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love


The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free

I'm sleeping
And right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up
From something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I dread
""I think I love you!""
(I think I love you)

This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And didn't I go and shout it
When you walked into my room
""I think I love you!""
(I think I love you)

I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
That I've never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I've got so much to think about
Hey!!

I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I never felt this way

Believe me
You really don't have to worry
I only want to make you happy
And if you say ""Hey, go away"", I will
But I think better still
I better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face

Do you think you love me?
I think I love you!

En la vida hay tantos senderos por caminar
Que ironía que al fin nos llevan al mismo lugar
A pesar de las diferencias que solemos buscar
Respiramos el mismo aire, despertamos al mismo sol
Nos alumbra la misma luna, necesitamos sentir amor
Nos alumbra la misma luna, necesitamos sentir amor
Hay tanto tiempo que hemos perdido por discutir
Por diferencias que entre nosotros no deben existir
Las costumbres, raíces y herencias
Que me hacen quien soy
Son colores de un arco iris acordes de un mismo son
Las palabras se hacen fronteras
Cuando no nacen del corazón
Hablemos el mismo idioma y así las cosas irán mejor
Hablemos el mismo idioma
Que hay tantas cosas porque luchar
Hablemos el mismo idioma
Que solo unidos se lograran
Hablemos el mismo idioma
Que nunca es tarde para empezar
Hablemos el mismo idioma
Bajo la bandera de libertad
Si lo pensamos nosotros tenemos tanto en común
Y nos conviene que el mundo nos oiga con una sola voz
Es importante seguir adelante con fuerza y con fe
Forjemos nuevos caminos en la unión hay un gran poder
Orgullosos de ser latinos no importa de donde
Todo podemos vencer

No importa de donde seas si todos
Somos hermanos, tu ves

No importa raza ni religión somos hermanos

997,,Your Song,Lady Gaga,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but, but then again, no
Or a woman who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world (Ooh hoo)

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of these verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Well anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
It's yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

Let this be the way we remember us

And I ain't asking for forgiveness

Give me a memory I can use

In the late hours of the night
Oh, what a fearful sight
Blood in the water
And oh he came to be
My blackest memory
He washed his hands to me
Now there's blood in the water

He said: Don’t do this
Forgive me
He's begging me for mercy
I looked him in the eye
Gave him a crooked smile
Put him out of my misery
And now there's

Blood, blood, blood in the water
In the water
Blood in the water
Blood, blood, blood in the water
In the water
Blood in the water
Down, down, down to the devil you goes
In the water
Blood in the water

And when the lawmen came
He asked me to explain
Just how my lover boy came
To lie in the water
I said: It was no crime
He was no love of mine
His blood was the coldest kind
Now it’s all in the water

He said: Don't do this
Forgive me
Was begging me for mercy
I looked him in the eye
Gave him a crooked smile
Put him out of my misery
And now there's

Blood, blood, blood in the water
In the water

Slow dancing with somebody I used to be

Our love was only gettin' started
Oh, why does a star shine brightest at the end?

I got a ghost under my skin
Slow burning like a lullaby you'd sing to me
Like blowing smoke into the wind
You're fading like a melody too bittersweet to be

So wake me on the other side
I'm going there again tonight
Our love was only gettin' started
Oh, why does a star shine brightest at the end?

1028,,Lose Yourself,Eminem,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music

1034,,Passin' Me By,The Pharcyde,"Now, in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school, I'd carry lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand, to make her stand, come to my desk, and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes, indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First, I'd write her name, then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass
She keeps on passin' me by! (Uh, bye...)
She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by! (Yes she does...) (But nevertheless, I'll say it again that–)
She keeps on pass—

When I dream of fairy tales, I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype, and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play love by the ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her— (And I could be her...)
All I could do was stare
Back as kids, we used to kiss when we played Truth Or Dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book, and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop the stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by

Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me ""Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop""
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I'd prove to be a better man

She keeps on passin' me by! (Passin' me by...)
She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again) (Passin' me by-aye-aye...)
She keeps on passin' me—

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when–
Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance, I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter, to get her, and it went:
""My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me, but I know you very well
Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I feel for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man, then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed: ""Sincerely
The one who loves you dearly
P.S. Love Me Tender""
But the letter came back three days later: ""Return to Sender""
Damn...

She keeps on passin' me by!
She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again that–)
She keeps on passin' me by! (But nevertheless, I'll say it again that–)
She keeps on pass—

But nevertheless, I'll say it again
(She keeps passing me by-aye-aye-aye...)
But nevertheless, I'll say it again (Yeah...)
But nevertheless— (Bye...)
But nevertheless— (Woo!)
But nevertheless, I'll say it again

She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)

There was no reason, no explanation

1054,,The Gift,The Velvet Underground,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit
It was now mid-August, which meant he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months
Two months, and all he had to show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone calls
True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to Locust, Pennsylvania
She had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity
She would date occasionally, but merely as amusement
She would remain faithful
But lately Waldo had begun to worry
He had trouble sleeping at night
And when he did, he had horrible dreams
He lay awake at night
Tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector
Tears welling in his eyes as he pictured Marsha
Her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some Neanderthal
Finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion
It was more than the human mind could bear
Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him
Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts
And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how she really was
He, Waldo, alone understood this
He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche
He had made her smile
She needed him, and he wasn't there (Aw)
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled to appear
He'd just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons' lawn for a dollar fifty
And had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha
There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs
At least they cared enough to write
It was a New York company
You could go anywhere in the mails
Then it struck him
He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion, true
But why not mail himself?
It was absurdly simple
He would ship himself parcel post, special delivery
The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment
He bought masking tape, a staple gun
And a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build
He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably
A few air holes, some water, perhaps some midnight snacks
And it would probably be as good as going tourist
By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set
He was thoroughly packed and the Post Office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock
He'd marked the package ""Fragile""
And as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber cushioning he'd thoughtfully included
He tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marsha's face
As she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the deliverer
And then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person
She would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie
If he'd only thought of this before
Suddenly rough hands gripped his package, and he felt himself borne up
He landed with a thud in a truck and was off
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair
It had been a very rough weekend
She had to remember not to drink like that
Bill had been nice about it though
After it was over he'd said he still respected her
And, after all, it was certainly the way of nature
And even though, no, he didn't love her, he did feel an affection for her
And after all, they were grown adults
Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo
But that seemed many years ago
Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend
Walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen
""Oh god, it's absolutely maudlin outside""
""Ach, I know what you mean, I feel all icky""
Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge
Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table
Licked her finger and made a face
""I'm supposed to be taking these salt pills, but,"" she wrinkled her nose
""They make me feel like throwing up""
Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd seen on television
""God, don't even talk about that""
She got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins
""Want one? Supposed to be better than steak""
And then attempted to touch her knees
""I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again""
She gave up and sat down
This time nearer the small table that supported the telephone
""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she said to Sheila's glance
Sheila nibbled on a cuticle
""After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him""
""I know what you mean
My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place""
She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense
""The thing is, after a while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know
And after all I didn't really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him
You know what I mean""
She started to scratch
Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth
""I'll tell you, I felt the same way
And even after a while""
Here she bent forward in a whisper
""I wanted to""
Now she was laughing very loudly
It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang the doorbell of the large stucco-colored frame house
When Marsha Bronson opened the door, he helped her carry the package in
He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den
""What do you think it is?"" Sheila asked
Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back
She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room
""I dunno""
Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices
Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton
""Why don't you look at the return address and see who it's from""
Waldo felt his heart beating
He could feel the vibrating footsteps
It would be soon
Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label
""Ah, god, it's from Waldo""
""That schmuck,"" said Sheila
Waldo trembled with expectation
""Well, you might as well open it,"" said Sheila
And both of them tried to lift the staple flap
""Ah sst,"" said Marsha, groaning
""He must have nailed it shut""
They tugged on the flap again
""My God, you need a power drill to get this thing open""
They pulled again
""You can't get a grip""
They both stood still, breathing heavily
""Why don't you get a scissor,"" said Sheila
Marsha ran into the kitchen
But all she could find was a little sewing scissor
Then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tools in the basement
She ran downstairs
And when she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand
""This is the best I could find""
She was very out of breath
""Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die""
She sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily
Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap
But the blade was too big and there wasn't enough room
""God damn this thing,"" she said, feeling very exasperated
Then smiling, ""I got an idea""
""What?"" said Marsha
""Just watch,"" said Sheila, touching her finger to her head
Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe
His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his heart beating in his throat
It would be soon
Sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package
Then she sank down to her knees
Grasped the cutter by both handles
Took a deep breath
And plunged the long blade through the middle of the package
Through the masking tape
Through the cardboard, through the cushioning
And right through the center of Waldo Jeffers' head
Which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
To pulsate gently in the morning sun",

I wouldn't change a thing, so glad you're back again

You know I didn't forget you

But you know that I didn't forget you
We just got swallowed up by the whole damn world

I borrowed your silver boots
Now if you'd just let me give them back to you

Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before

I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I'm findin' myself with you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before

Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls

The cretins cloning and feeding
And I don't even own a TV
Put me in the hospital for nerves
And then they had to commit me
You told them all I was crazy
They cut off my legs
Now I'm an amputee, goddamn you

And rage against machines
I wanna pierce my tongue

And kill my mind
You kill my mind

Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's comin' to get me
Just say you never met me
I'm runnin' underground with the moles
Diggin' holes
Hear the voices in my head

The agony and the irony

Si el sentimiento que nos une no es el mismo
Sigamos siendo mejor buenos amigos

Esperaré un día y otro, lleno de ansias
Hasta que quieras abrigarme dentro de tu alma
Quiero vivir con una ilusión
De que algún día me amarás
No importa el tiempo que te tenga que esperar
Todas las cosas que me dices son tan bellas
Que a veces siento que me estoy enamorando
Pero despierto y me detengo
Antes de entrar en un error
Pues vale más un buen amigo que un mal amor

Si el sentimiento fuera igual en ti y en mi
Nuestro amor sería de gloria y éxtasis
Pero querer y amar no es lo mismo
Siempre es más grande el amor que el cariño
Y aunque tengamos tantas cosas en común
Puede ser que falle yo o falles tú
Si el sentimiento que nos une no es el mismo
Sigamos siendo mejor buenos amigos",

The evidence she required
Takes five, she's got pearls

If you know what she thinks
If you knew what she was after

Sometimes she wonders
And she laughs in her frustration

Would someone, please, explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade

Doctors of the revolution gave us
The medicine we desired
Besides being absolutely painless
It's a question of compromise
They got steel
So cool to get angry at the weekend
And go back to school
So big deal, it's what rule
When it comes to making money
Say yes, please, thank you

And ask yourself the question

I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again

I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you

Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

In labyrinths of coral caves

Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance, two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the Sun

Cloudless, every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide

May encounter dragons or ruffians and be

In a battle for supremacy and access to

And even if you are victorious you may receive
Many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds

Waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove
In your mouth, and that's why you

Ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves
Microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like, ""Ooh ooh! That really hurts!""
(Going off into the tundra)
So pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying
To pollinate the echinacea, until God said
""I'ma smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two!""
And Adam wept and wailed
Tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to
The sky and said, ""Thank God...""",

Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes
March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why

Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray
There’s no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty
Thrice for another day

Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown

Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton
We'll break our fast with friends
Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends

Shut your ears when sirens sing,
Tie armbands to your feet
Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes

1171,,She Used To Be Mine,Sara Bareilles,"It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them

It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect, but she tries
She is good, but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

And it's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person
Who makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you

And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised
And gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her to fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine

She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time

Que despertamos abrazados con ganas de seguir amándonos
Pero es que en realidad no aceptan nuestro amor

Hablamos sin hablar todo es silencio en nuestro andar

Perché nei sogni credo ancor
Lo strano gioco del destino
A Portofino m'ha preso il cuor

Nel dolce incanto del mattino
Il mare ti ha portato a me
Socchiudo gli occhi e a me vicino
A Portofino rivedo te
Ricordo un angolo di cielo
Dove ti stavo ad aspettar
Ricordo il volto tanto amato
E la tua bocca da baciar

I found my love in Portofino
Quei baci più non scorderò
Non è più triste il mio cammino
A Portofino I found my love

Il y avait à Portofino
Un vieux clocher qui s'ennuyait
De ne sonner que les matines
Quand Portofino se réveillait
Mais après cette nuit divine
On l'entendit sonner un jour
Même jusqu'aux villes voisines
De Portofino pour notre amour
Je vois le marié qui m'emporte
Vers le petit chalet de bois
Dont il me fait franchir la porte
En me portant entre ses bras

A chaque fois qu'à Portofino
Le vieux clocher sonne là-haut
Il chante notre mariage
Vers les nuages a Portofino

I found my love
I found my love

1177,,Ladrillo Y Cemento,Lng Sht,"Tenemos dos perros
¿A quién quieren más?, nunca sabremos
Un librero con novelas, revistas y biografías
Libros de filosofía que fabrican nuestros pensamientos
El refri forrado en calcas de las bandas
Que han dormido en el piso, en la sala
O sonado en lo más profundo de mi oreja
Amor es no robarle los audífonos a tu pareja
Hay una mesa de plástico
De alguna cervecera, el logo to' raspado
¿Comprar otra?, mira, quizá podría
Pero ahí cenamos manjares y quesadillas
Mientras comentamos los días, los sueños, las dudas
Los sagrados alimentos nos producen agruras (Antiácido)
Tras el espejo del lavabo sonrío
Nuestros cepillos (Igual duermen lado a lado)
Bajo la temperatura, diantres
Entrelazo mis coyunturas con las tuyas sin aguantes
En el armario nada me queda como antes
Nuestra casa (En medio de la calle como Madness)
Envases vacíos, caguamas en el piso
La botella de vino, el cuarto de Bombay Sapphire
Hay que ordenar el bar, tenemos motivo
Brindar por la sencilla vida que hemos construido
De la sala al comedor, debajo del cobertor
No necesitamos más si estamos tú y yo
Cuando hay frío hay calor, to'a la tarde en el sillón
No necesitamos más si estamos tú y yo, sólo tú y yo
Tenemos una mancha que dejó ""Cucho"" en la alfombra
Y hay que pagar el gas y la luz o nos la cortan
Por norma adornan seis discos la torna
Me obsesiono con Mos Def y tu Atmosphere
Pues qué importa si nada combina en este orfelinato
De cobijas y cojines, platos y vasos de cine
Un proyector para los fines si vienen los panas
La pantalla mediana para seguirla en la cama
La cafetera sucia, la colección de tazas
El bong y el botiquín donde alcobas la ganja
Los guardas cuando las mamás visitan nuestras tierras
Subimos tres pisos pa' que fumes en la azotea
La bicicleta estática para los días que llueva
Y mi guitarra acústica con óxido en las cuerdas
El Vicky Jones de visita, no importa cuando vengas
Tres golpes en la puerta, pasó la casera
Y el mes sobre el tapete viendo un slasher
Tengo un guacal junto a retrete con mi colección de Thrasher
El piso mojado, la lavadora sus daños
Pienso en los pleitos ahorrados si tuviéramos dos baños
¿Cuántos años viviendo juntos?
¿Que tenemos cuántos años siendo adultos?
Tenemos tantas cosas esperando a que nos pasen
Y a mí que me emociona el vivir cada percance contigo
De la sala al comedor, debajo del cobertor
No necesitamos más si estamos tú y yo
Cuando hay frío hay calor, to'a la tarde en el sillón
No necesitamos más si estamos tú y yo, sólo tú y yo
Tenemos demasiado apego, por eso sesenta metros de concreto
Varilla y cemento, ladrillo y mortero
Un lugar lleno de recuerdos
Ese lugar no es mi hogar, es nuestro apartamento
Mi hogar es más que eso, mi hogar es carne y hueso
Es dormir con tus abrazos y despertar con tus besos
La rutina, las bromas, los pleitos, los miedos y el resto
Lo que dejó de ser tuyo, mío, pa' hacerse nuestro
Así que quema el edificio (Quema el edificio)
Moja las escrituras (Moja las escrituras)
No necesito un anillo (No, no)
Para saber que quiero pasar mi vida con la tuya

De conseguirme tu aprobación
Y la de otros también

En ese tiempo era otro yo
Era otro yo, la que se perdió
Tú me tenías a tu alrededor
Para acariciar, para agrandarte el ego
Sentía una presión, algo que me ataba
Ahora lo veo con la claridad
Me elegiste porque lo iba a dar

Ya no se trata de ti, no se trata de ti
Sabemos lo que hiciste
Yo era tan susceptible
Ya no más, ya crecí

Decías que nadie iba a querer
Nadie iba a querer, que nadie iba a quererme
Como tú lo hacías y te entregué
Lo di y lo entregué, lo di y lo entregué todo
Qué equivocada estaba en creerte
Porque una vida nueva ya venía, donde me iban a querer

Dejaste escombros
Me dejaste demonios circulando
Ahora los miro a la cara
Les digo no son tanto

Buscando algún escondite
Para decirnos las cosas que solo con palabras
Imposible decirse

Telling the truth it might mean you get broken
But letting it hurt that's my method of coping
Doubt in season like that smoke in my lungs
What they project on me what I've become
Down on my knees unsure what to say
No I never learned how to prey
Don't know know who I been fooling
But you got me running in circles I'm ruined
Let you inside opened up all my wounds
Taking my ribcage and ripped it in two


Tie off all my tendons
Watch how they stretch
Oh I've got the muscle
But lord, I'm spent
Knocking down my sternum
Began at a young age
Too much space between
Open up my ribcage


There's impenetrable silence inside of my head
There's nothing I can vibe with, I'm practically dead
I get so tired of writing everything I should have said
That maybe this time I'll put my pen down and just tell you instead

Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be
