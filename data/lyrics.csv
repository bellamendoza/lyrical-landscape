0,Ella Baila Sola,Eslabon Armado,"Compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
Bella, ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón, te cumplo todo
Me agarró, pеgadito de su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, quе al pasar fui yo
Su cuerpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta"
1,These Words,Natasha Bedingfield,"My heart
These words are my own
(Uh, yeah, uh)

Threw some chords together
The combination: D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do (Yeah, uh)
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration (But it's not coming easily)

(Whoa) Tryna find the magic
(Oh) Tryna write a classic (Whoa)
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? (Whoa, whoa)
Wastebin full of paper (Whoa)
Clever rhymes, see ya later

These words are my own
From my heart flow (Yeah, uh)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you (Ah)

Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean (Uh)
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (From my heart flow)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say (Uh)
I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you, I love you)
These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Yeah)
(I love you) I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you)
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

I'm gettin' off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes (Love you, love you)
Whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa

(Whoa) Tryna find the magic
(Whoa) Tryna write a classic (Uh, yeah)
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Don't you know?)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way, to better say)
To better say (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you
These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (They are from my heart, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you (I love you)
There's no other way (There's no better way)
To better say (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you

These words are my own
They're from my heart (My heart)
(Yeah, uh) I love you, I love you
That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say (Yeah, uh, yeah)
I love you, is that okay?"

3,Vanish Into You,Lady Gaga,"Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime

High on a hill, you call
Two lovers regret their time
Once in a blue moon, I forget you
And once in your life, you'll be mine

Do you see me? Do you see me now?
I've been waiting for you, cryin' out
Do you see me? Do you see me now?

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you? (Yah)

Into the night, we fly
Sirens blow by our heads (Yah)

Do you see me? Do you see me now?
I've been waiting for you, cryin' out
Do you see me? Do you see me now?

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you?

(Yah)

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by, by, by, by my bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I, I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you? (Can I? Can I?)
Like a ghost, I, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, vanish into you
Can I vanish into you?

When I die, can I vanish into you?"

Help me build a mountain from my little pile of clay
Hey, hey, hey

Well, she knows what I'm about

And she knows just what to do, and how to please me

9,Una Vida Buena,Kany García,"Me desperté cansada
Cansada de vivir en una vida que no me da nada
Tan triste, aburrida, deprimida, pero con más ganas
De hacer una maleta y mandar todo pa' la chingada

Y bailar
Hasta que me duelan los talone'
Volverme una rompecorazones
Y que to's se enamoren de mí

Yo quiero vivir una vida buena
Un traguito 'e ron de almuerzo y de cena
Si me lleva el diablo, que valga la pena
Así voy a vivir y así quiero morir
Ya no tengo marido, tengo una vida buena
Tеngo un par de jevo' y una que otra jеva
Y si me quedo pobre, pobre pero buena
Yo me quiero tanto

Quiero comprar lo que quiera sin mirar la cuenta
A mí ya nadie me espera y menos me gobierna
Ciao, que ya no te quiero aquí, al la'o
Te me saliste del corazón
Al fin no eras tan bueno
Tú era' como una mala canción
Que ya ni me la recuerdo

Y bailar
Y hacer to' lo que a mí se me antoje
Volverme una rompecorazones
Y que to's se enamoren de mí

Yo quiero vivir una vida buena
Un traguito 'e ron de almuerzo y de cena
Si me lleva el diablo, que valga la pena
Así voy a vivir y así quiero morir
Ya no tengo marido, tengo una vida buena
Tengo un par de jevo' y una que otra jeva
Y si me quedo pobre, pobre pero buena
Yo me quiero tanto
Y ya no tengo marido, tengo una vida buena
Tengo un par de jevo' y una que otra jeva
Y si me quedo pobre, pobre pero buena
Yo me quiero tanto

Ay, toda para mí"
10,La Malquerida,Kany García,"Yo solo quería la verdad y tú con tus mentiras
Me abriste los ojos, también las heridas
Y aunque te tenía de primera en mi plan de vida
Dejándolo todo por tu compañía

¿Pa' que voy a suplicarte y a querer volver?
Si así de lejitos nos llevamos bien
Y en cualquier momento la vuelves a hacer

Ay, qué dolor
Cuanto me han herido
Yo que lo di todo, y cuanto me han jodido
Por eso sé que tú hoy juegas con mi mente
Por eso sé que tú no eras diferente
Ay, yo tengo carita de inocente
Pero tengo espuelas, tengo afilado los dientes

Ya me contaron que te vieron con alguien
Y aunque quise matarte, que te vaya bien
A mí me gusta respirar buenos aires
Y si vuelvo a buscarte, sería perder

¿Pa' que voy a suplicarte y a querer volver?
Si así de lejitos nos llevamos bien
Y en cualquier momento la vuelves a hacer

Ay, qué dolor
Cuanto me han herido
Yo que lo di todo, y cuanto me han jodido
Por eso sé que tú hoy juegas con mi mente
Por eso sé que tú no eras diferente
Ay, yo tengo carita de inocente
Pero tengo espuelas, tengo afilado los dientes

Me dicen la malquerida, pero bueno
Me dejaste alguna herida, y eso es bueno
Me emborracho todos los días, ay, qué bueno
Y celebro tu partida de nuevo
Me dicen la malquerida, pero bueno
Me dejaste alguna herida, y eso es bueno
Me emborracho todos los días, ay, qué bueno
Y celebro tu partida de nuevo

Ay, qué dolor
Cuanto me han herido
Yo que lo di todo, y cuanto me han jodido
Por eso sé que tú hoy juegas con mi mente
Por eso sé que tú no eras diferente
Ay, yo tengo carita de inocente
Pero tengo espuelas, tengo afilado los dientes

Me dicen la malquerida, pero bueno
Me dejaste alguna herida, y eso es bueno
Me emborracho todos los días, ay, qué bueno
Y celebro tu partida de nuevo (La malquerida)
Me dicen la malquerida, pero bueno
Me dejaste alguna herida, y eso es bueno
Me emborracho todos los días, ay, qué bueno
Y celebro tu partida de nuevo"
11,Historia Repetida,Kany García,"Tú con esas ganas que tenías de salir corriendo
Y yo que ya me olía que esto estaba cerca del final
Lo que tanto construimos ya se lo ha llevado el viento
Justo lo que más le tuve miedo me ha vuelto a pasar-ar

Y ya me lo decía yo, que te volverías un mal necesario
Ya me lo advertía yo, que me dolería dormir en tus labios
Ya me repetía yo, y fui justamente haciendo lo contrario
Ni tú, ni yo, ni tú, ni yo

Somos los culpablеs de lo que ha pasado
Tú querías quеrerme y yo ya te quería
Yo que te tenía mal acostumbrado a que tus migajas me satisfacían
Tú buscando fuerzas pa' quererme, pero tan cerca de la salida
Esto lo ha vivido tanta gente, somos una historia repetida

Ya me lo decía yo, que te volverías un mal necesario
Ya me lo advertía yo, que me dolería dormir en tus labios
Ya me repetía yo, y fui justamente haciendo lo contrario
Ni tú, ni yo, ni tú, ni yo

Si ya me lo decía yo, que te volverías un mal necesario
Ya me lo advertía yo, que me dolería dormir en tus labios
Ya me repetía yo, y fui justamente haciendo lo contrario
Ni tú, ni yo, ni tú, ni yo

Ni tú, ni yo, ni tú, ni yo"
12,En Esta Boca,Kany García,"Ella, la que te enreda en sus pisadas
Con su sonrisa en primavera
Y sus ojos que la delataban
Yo me acerqué y me pegué porque sentía a la vez
Que su mirada me hablaba lo que no me decía
Ella esperó a que apaguen las luces, y yo quería encenderle la vida

En esta boca te volvías tan loca
Tu mirada de fuego me quitaba la ropa
Me decía' ""te quiero""
Ay, no te vaya' ahora, no
Si en esta boca te volvías tan loca
Se achicaban tus miedo', te olvidaba' de cosa'
Que nos llenan de frenos (De frenos)
Ay, no te vayas ahora (Yeah)

Te di de la que enchula y no me saca' de tu mente
Cuando somo' tú y yo en contra e' la corriente
Dice que no puede ni decir lo que siente
'Toy pa' robarte delincuente, ey, y lo malo es que te gusta
No sea' injusta, ojitos que delatan, no me asustan
Es a mí a la que busca', uff
Ojalá te me luzca', uff, sí
Si yo siento lo que siente', no te cohíba'
Si yo sé

Que en esta boca te volvía' tan loca
Tu mirada de fuego me quemaba la ropa
Me decías ""te quiero"" (Te quiero)
Ay, no te vaya' ahora (No te vaya' ahora)
Si en esta boca se volvía tan loca
Se achicaban sus miedo', se olvidaba de cosa'
Que nos llenan de frenos
Ay, no te vayas ahora, no

Yo no te espero, pero, déjate el cuento (Ah-ah-ah)
Te pasa' merodeando donde frecuento
Yo sé que tú tiene' un jevo, pero yo te lo hago má' bueno
Yo no te espero, pero, déjate el cuento
Te pasa' merodeando donde frecuento
Yo sé que tú tienes un jevo, pero conmigo va' de nuevo

Si en esta boca te volvía' tan loca
Tu mirada de fuego me quitaba la ropa
Me decía' ""te quiero"" (Te quiero)
Ay, no te vaya' ahora, no (No te vaya')
Si en esta boca te volvía' tan loca
Se achicaban tus miedo', te olvidaba' de cosa'
Que nos llenan de frenos
Ay, no te vayas ahora"
13,Amar y Partir,Zoe Gotusso,"A veces quiero que todo salga bien
Pero si pido más, me queda menos
Debo soltar la tensión que hay en mí
Alimentarme de tu amor sincero

Y para mi sería hermoso
Que tu fueras para mí
Y para ti sería un regalo
Que elegiste para abrir

Ayer te vi y te salía el sol
Si estoy con vos de nada tengo miedo
No piso el freno si me acompañas
Yo no me voy, pero yo no me quedo

Y para mi sería hermoso
Que tu fueras para mí
Y para ti sería un regalo
Que elegiste para abrir

Y sin embargo no me arrepentí
Porque hay algo que aprendí
Amar, partir, vivir así
Me voy pero siempre vuelvo

Y para mi sería hermoso
Que tu fueras para mí
Y para ti sería un regalo
Que elegiste para abrir
Y para mi sería hermoso
Que tu fueras para mí
Y para ti sería un regalo
Que elegiste para abrir"
14,Voy a Olvidarme de Mí (feat. Bomba Estéreo),Zoe Gotusso,"Que no es lo mismo verse en el espejo, que te siento lejos
Que muero por dentro y escucho en silencio
Que la lluvia dice que ya te perdí

Que no me importa si la casa es grande
Si me voy de viaje
Que el negocio es bueno
Si ese era mi sueño
Si el carro que tengo corre a más de mil

Que me arrepiento de ser aguafiestas
Todos estos años que viví contigo
Que me perdones si no me di cuenta
Que fui tu dueño y quiero ser tu amiga

Voy a peinarme y a tender la cama
Voy a ponerme mi mejor vestido
Voy a servir tu puesto allí en la mesa
Para sentir que vuelvo a estar contigo
Voy a pedirle al tiempo que no pase
Voy a encender la luz de mis promesas
Voy a sentarme al frente de la calle
Para esperar a ver si tú regresas

Que he sido un tonta por dejarte sola
Por buscar mil cosas
Por mi gran invento si al final del cuento
Yo ya nada tengo si no estás aquí

Que no me importa si la casa es grande
Si me voy de viaje
Que el negocio es bueno
Si ese era mi sueño
Si el carro que tengo corre a más de mil

Que me arrepiento de ser aguafiestas
Todos estos años que viví contigo
Que me perdones si no me di cuenta
Que fui tu dueño y quiero ser tu amiga

Voy a peinarme y a tender la cama
Voy a ponerme mi mejor vestido
Voy a servir tu puesto allí en la mesa
Para sentir que vuelvo a estar contigo
Voy a pedirle al tiempo que no pase
Voy a encender la luz de mis promesas
Voy a sentarme en frente de la calle
Para esperar a ver si tú regresas

Voy a olvidarme de mí
Yo puedo hacerte feliz
Nos quedaremos aquí
Voy a olvidarme de mí"
15,O My Heart,Mother Mother,"Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun
Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh my heart, it's a rock and great boulder and stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far, it come back floating
And I watch it wash it up with the dead fish
But it ain't quite dead, it just is like this
Oh my heart, it's a house in tornado
Oh my heart, it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
Oh my heart, it's a roof in El Niño
Oh my heart, it's a roof made of straw in the jaw of El Niño

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard, it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name, I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in

Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum
Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum
Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum buhhh...

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh my heart, it's the black in a rainbow
Oh my heart, it's so damn so cold, so damn cold

And I throw my heart into the fire
'Cause I want to set my heart on fire
And I watch it try, befriending embers
But the ice don't melt in mid-December

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun"
16,Ambidextrous,Rosa Cecilia,"Verse 1:
Do you know who you are?
Do you know the lives of brothers?
I am in the right mind
To snitch you to your mother
Do you empathise beyond the realms of yourself?
Do you try to challenge
Elements of convention
I doubt it
I doubt it
By the look of your Twitter page
You don’t think I have rights
You don’t think I should talk
You don’t believe a female
Should be pro-choice at all
You believe my friends
Of black and brown descent
Should bow and kiss the feet of holy colonialism and...
I doubt that
(we can be friends)… I doubt it
Chorus:
All these disparities
Left and right can’t find no unity
All these disparities
And I don’t want to be ambidextrous
All these disparities
Chia seeds and collard greens
All these disparities
And I don’t want to be ambidextrous

Verse 2:
Should I file a complaint
Who would even listen ? I’m a lying little temptress
Extremist feminism I would like to provide an extensive list of writers
From Morrison to Davis
Does that could entice ya?
I doubt it
I doubt it
Chorus:
All these disparities
Left and right can’t find no unity
All these disparities
And I don’t want to be ambidextrous
All these disparities
Chia seeds and collard greens
All these disparities
And I don’t want to be ambidextrous
Bridge:
Is it I against you?
Is it you against me?
Am I shutting out Potential harmony?
What do I have to lose?
There’s more than meets the eye
Conflict is cutting. Let’s unify...
Chorus:
All these disparities
Left and right can’t find no unity
All these disparities
And I don’t want to be ambidextrous
All these disparities
Chia seeds and collard greens
All these disparities
And I don’t want to be ambidextrous"

Feelings alive, but they'll never show
All of my heroes are people I know
Never see faces that look like my own

I wanna take it easy, retreat in my soul
I wanna feel your body when my hands are cold
Got me addicted to something you have
Let it grow inside me, it makes me so mad

It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad"

Probably since, like, your last EP, 'Oh the Places You'll Go'
Oh wow, it's been a minute, yeah (Yeah)
I've been gettin' some calls
Oh?
People are a little bit worried about you
Not worried, okay
And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
You were
Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
Okay

Remember old dude from 2019?
Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021

Okay, I just feel like
This is the perfect opportunity for us to just take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you, and—
Mm, nah (Ow), fuck it

""Platinum record"" this, ""viral record"" that (That)
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (Yeah)
Wrist watch, drip drop, label want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what thee fuck?
I need a cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me, 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and—

Honestly, I can't even fucking cap no more, this is a really dark time for me
I'm going through a lot
By ""a lot,"" you mean drugs?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just saying
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh

I mean, fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar ""oops"" made me loopy
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans

Woah! Woah, woah, woah, woah! (Rurr)
Okay, Doechii
We don't wanna revert back into our old ways (Sorry, okay)
So, we're gonna try a breathing exercise, okay? (A'ight, word)

Yo te ayudo a olvidar el pasado
No te aferres, ya no te aferres
A un imposible, ya no te hagas
Ni me hagas mas dao
Ya nooo!!! no no no no no"

Me llevo to' el mall monta'o en un camión
Combino el rojo con el rosa, vestidas de blanco
Me visto de novia pero no soy tu esposa
Las tennis Valentino, y bizcocho de Moschino
Gargantilla de zafiro con diamante azul marino
Y si hoy llevo la ropa fake, es porque soy la más real

S-s-said I scared off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 now
Said I don't like it when I'm on my shit, 'cause I'm just so much better than you
Pull up the fine print, love and all vibin'
'Til they see girl like better somehow

Who's gonna run when they hear my sound, now?
Who's gonna run when they hear my–
Who's gonna run when they hear my–
Don't want no guy to run off and cry, 'cause I played him some of my worst
Sounds like a lie, happened in real time
Hope he don't feel no worse or no hurt

Said I'm on my, I do like this
No, I didn't come to play
You could be on yours, but you keep on getting in my way
They say, ""Way way too good to me"", so that thеy never stay
I've been told diffеrences, but think that it's jealousy

I think that's jealousy, now
I think that is jealousy
I think that's jealousy, now
I think that is jealousy

T-tellin' me not your style
All ideas lame, wack, it's twisted
Sit a little, ah-ah, wait for a while
And it's like whole mindset is shifted
See you really runnin' up my style
Wrap it up nice, pass it on, it's gifted
I-I think it's vile
I think–, I think it's vile, now
'Cause they keep telling me, ""Enemies love you like friend to me""
Hate me, but they love my flow
All of the talkin', like why you so for it?
Your back to corner with nowhere to go
Some of my mistakes that I made on ways
If I share my yays, will you take my worst?
Love to the strays from back in the day
They come and they play in the game I wrote

Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my

47,Fuck Me Pumps,Amy Winehouse,"Woo

When you walk in the bar
And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your ""eff me"" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer’s wife

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped

How'd you learn to love if you're not taught to?
How do you dream of freedoms on a curfew?
Paying the price to live in our skin
It's wearing me thin

Who's got heart for the aching?

We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row the boat

Gambling the heartbreak of a nation
Breaking up the euros at the station
Visiting a bank for bread and butter
Don't want to see no doctor when we suffer
Think I got a neighbour that's been feeling blue

Fucking with a kingdom that never fought for you

56,19th Floor,Joy Crookes,"Nineteenth floor

Headed back to where I started
Past the fireflies of Rizla burning bright
Lost the tower where my heart is
Cinema skylines that I don't recognise
Strip the life out of these streets
It's a daylight robbery
You'll never take the London out of me

I was raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong

Nothing same but nothing different
Hear the people cry concrete lullabies
I never thought I'd say I miss it
See it speaking when I walk
Don't test the waters

I was raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong

Bopping down Walworth Road, bubblegum blow
Sliders and Sunday clothes
Doing like my Nani, 70s steez
Cardamom stain my teeth
I see the things you've seen
But you don't speak, you leave the traces
Like I picked up a parcel handed down through generations

Raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong"

See me on the TV and scream: ""That's Uncle Kendrick!""

With your khaki string vest intact

Told you I don't vouch for love, G
It takes too much of my power

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong

Spending nights in lonely castles
Where I learned to sing my cries
Sweetest sixteen, thrown to test me
I could not sit still if I tried

Learnin' to run before I could walk out
Learnin' to cuss before I could talk it out
Nah, nah, nah

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong

No hands (No, no hands)
Nobody cradles me like I can
No, like I can

Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

S-s-said I scared off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 now

Pull up the fine print, love and all vibin'
'Til they see girl like better somehow
Doin' up my thing, good for the writin'
Who's gonna run when they hear my sound, now?
Who's gonna run when they hear my–
Who's gonna run when they hear my–
Don't want no guy to run off and cry, 'cause I played him some of my worst
Sounds like a lie, happened in real time
Hope he don't feel no worse or no hurt

Said I'm on my, I do like this
No, I didn't come to play
You could be on yours, but you keep on getting in my way
They say, ""Way way too good to me"", so that thеy never stay
I've been told diffеrences, but think that it's jealousy

I think that's jealousy, now
I think that is jealousy
I think that's jealousy, now
I think that is jealousy

T-tellin' me not your style
All ideas lame, wack, it's twisted
Sit a little, ah-ah, wait for a while
And it's like whole mindset is shifted
See you really runnin' up my style
Wrap it up nice, pass it on, it's gifted
I-I think it's vile
I think–, I think it's vile, now
'Cause they keep telling me, ""Enemies love you like friend to me""
Hate me, but they love my flow
All of the talkin', like why you so for it?
Your back to corner with nowhere to go
Some of my mistakes that I made on ways
If I share my yays, will you take my worst?
Love to the strays from back in the day
They come and they play in the game I wrote

Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my

47,Fuck Me Pumps,Amy Winehouse,"Woo

When you walk in the bar
And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your ""eff me"" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer’s wife

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped

Headed back to where I started
Past the fireflies of Rizla burning bright
Lost the tower where my heart is
Cinema skylines that I don't recognise
Strip the life out of these streets
It's a daylight robbery
You'll never take the London out of me

I was raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong

Nothing same but nothing different
Hear the people cry concrete lullabies
I never thought I'd say I miss it
See it speaking when I walk
Don't test the waters

I was raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong

Bopping down Walworth Road, bubblegum blow
Sliders and Sunday clothes
Doing like my Nani, 70s steez
Cardamom stain my teeth
I see the things you've seen
But you don't speak, you leave the traces
Like I picked up a parcel handed down through generations

Raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong"

Told you I don't vouch for love, G
It takes too much of my power

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong

Spending nights in lonely castles
Where I learned to sing my cries
Sweetest sixteen, thrown to test me
I could not sit still if I tried

Learnin' to run before I could walk out
Learnin' to cuss before I could talk it out
Nah, nah, nah

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong

No hands (No, no hands)
Nobody cradles me like I can

Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

S-s-said I scared off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 now
Said I don't like it when I'm on my shit, 'cause I'm just so much better than you
Pull up the fine print, love and all vibin'
'Til they see girl like better somehow
Doin' up my thing, good for the writin'
Who's gonna run when they hear my sound, now?
Who's gonna run when they hear my–
Who's gonna run when they hear my–
Don't want no guy to run off and cry, 'cause I played him some of my worst
Sounds like a lie, happened in real time
Hope he don't feel no worse or no hurt

Said I'm on my, I do like this
No, I didn't come to play
You could be on yours, but you keep on getting in my way
They say, ""Way way too good to me"", so that thеy never stay
I've been told diffеrences, but think that it's jealousy

I think that's jealousy, now
I think that is jealousy
I think that's jealousy, now
I think that is jealousy

T-tellin' me not your style
All ideas lame, wack, it's twisted
Sit a little, ah-ah, wait for a while
And it's like whole mindset is shifted
See you really runnin' up my style
Wrap it up nice, pass it on, it's gifted
I-I think it's vile
I think–, I think it's vile, now
'Cause they keep telling me, ""Enemies love you like friend to me""
Hate me, but they love my flow
All of the talkin', like why you so for it?
Your back to corner with nowhere to go
Some of my mistakes that I made on ways
If I share my yays, will you take my worst?
Love to the strays from back in the day
They come and they play in the game I wrote

Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my
Said I'm on my, I'm on my

Rockin' your ""eff me"" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer’s wife

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life

Who's got heart for the aching?
No such thing as a Kingdom
When tomorrow's done for the children
They chop it up and divide
So meet me at the borderline
Where the burning bridges have been taking toll
We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row the boat

Gambling the heartbreak of a nation
Breaking up the euros at the station
Visiting a bank for bread and butter
Don't want to see no doctor when we suffer
Think I got a neighbour that's been feeling blue
But maybe that's a symptom
Fucking with a kingdom that never fought for you

Who's got love for the taking?
Who's got heart for the aching?
No such thing as a Kingdom
When tomorrow's done for the children
They chop it up and divide
So meet me at the borderline
Where the burning bridges have been taking toll
We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row the boat

Who's got love for the taking?
Who's got heart for the aching?
No such thing as a Kingdom
When tomorrow's done for the children
They chop it up and divide
So meet me at the borderline
Where the burning bridges have been taking toll
We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row the boat
We row, we row, we row"

54,Boss Bitch,Doja Cat,"Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna

Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew 'cause they hope I choke

I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss

Said bitch, I'm the after, you been the before
I been the stallion, you been the seahorse
Don't need a report, don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones
I wear the hat and I wear the pants
I am advanced, so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel the plans
Said boo, don't be mad 'cause you had the chance

Drop, said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it
Said I took it and I ran for it

55,Poison,Joy Crookes,"You're scared of snakes
I'm scared of you 'cause you've got poison
Like them, too
You shed on me
I pick it up
And all I do is clean up after you

The poison, you say you got it from your mother
The poison, there isn't anyone else to blame

Ba-da-da-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-da-da-dum

I caught you once
You tried to bite, you tried to scream
Maybe the poison is floating in my genes

The poison, you say you got it from some others
The poison, there isn't anyone else to blame

Ba-da-da-da-da-dum
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-dum

You need to learn
To sweep up your tracks
'Cause if you don't
Well, it's gonna get you back
It's gonna get you back

The poison, there isn't anyone else to blame

56,19th Floor,Joy Crookes,"Nineteenth floor

Headed back to where I started
Past the fireflies of Rizla burning bright
Lost the tower where my heart is
Cinema skylines that I don't recognise
Strip the life out of these streets
It's a daylight robbery
You'll never take the London out of me

I was raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong

Nothing same but nothing different
Hear the people cry concrete lullabies
I never thought I'd say I miss it
See it speaking when I walk
Don't test the waters

I was raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong

Bopping down Walworth Road, bubblegum blow
Sliders and Sunday clothes
Doing like my Nani, 70s steez
Cardamom stain my teeth
I see the things you've seen
But you don't speak, you leave the traces
Like I picked up a parcel handed down through generations

Raised by the river, nineteenth floor
We never got this high before
We were lost so long, look how far we've come
Down by the river, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong
Ooh, I remember where I belong"
57,Yah / Element - Medley,Joy Crookes,"I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real people conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, and fuck bitches
I double park the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in your head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, mmm
If I gotta slap a pussy ass, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
Like pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
No, take me out my element

Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth living
See me on the TV and scream: ""That's Uncle Kendrick!""
But it's money to get, bitches to hit (Yah)
Zeroes to flip, temptation is (Yah)
First on my list, I can't resist (Yah)
Everyone together now, know that we forever

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, mmm
If I gotta slap a pussy ass, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
Like pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
No, take me out my element

I'm going to make it look
I'ma make it look sexy, mmm
And they won't take me out my element"
58,No Hands,Joy Crookes,"Hey b-

Meet me South East on the downbeat
With your khaki string vest intact
Though you're handsome, there's a red sun
And I can't help wonder what's next
Then you ask me, ""What do you want from all our weekends in whiskey sour?""
Told you I don't vouch for love, G
It takes too much of my power

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong

Spending nights in lonely castles
Where I learned to sing my cries
Sweetest sixteen, thrown to test me
I could not sit still if I tried

Learnin' to run before I could walk out
Learnin' to cuss before I could talk it out
Nah, nah, nah

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong

No hands (No, no hands)
Nobody cradles me like I can
No, like I can
No hands (No, no hands)
Nobody cradles me like I can
No, like I can

Oh, can't stay too long
I might stain someone
Round and round I go
Got to set the tone
In the hands of none
That's where I belong
That's where I belong"
59,Hallelujah,Pentatonix,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well, it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composin' Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, yeah
Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah"
