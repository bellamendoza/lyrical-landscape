# Lyrical Landscape

## Overview
In this project, I will apply natural language processing techniques to analyze the lyrics of my Spotify Liked Songs. By examining the language and recurring themes within these lyrics, I aim to uncover patterns that may reveal personal emotional shifts or broader influences reflected in my music choices. Techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling will be used to explore the depth of the lyrical content.

## Key Questions
1. Are there any patterns or recurring themes in the lyrics of my liked songs?
2. Are there any interesting trends over time?
3. What role do lyrics play in my song preferences?


## Data
For this project, I generate data on my Spotify liked songs using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and extract lyrics using the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/).

## Methods
I use the following models:
- LDA Topic Modeling
